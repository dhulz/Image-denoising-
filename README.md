## Introduction

Image denoising is an essential task in image processing, aimed at removing noise from images while preserving important details. This project uses a U-Net model to perform image denoising on grayscale images.

## Features

- Implementation of a U-Net model for image denoising
- Custom PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) metric for performance evaluation
- Training and evaluation using image data generators
- Loading and preprocessing of images from a dataset stored on Google Drive

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains noisy and clean images for training and testing. Due to size constraints, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download the dataset from [this link](https://link.to/your/dataset.zip).

1. Download the dataset and upload it to your Google Drive.
2. The dataset should have the following structure:
    ```plaintext
    image-denoising/
    ├── dataset/
    │   ├── denoising dataset/
    │   │   ├── image denoising/
    │   │   │   ├── train/
    │   │   │   │   ├── noisy/
    │   │   │   │   ├── clean/
    │   │   │   ├── test/
    │   │   │   │   ├── noisy/
    │   │   │   │   ├── clean/
    ```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-denoising.git
    cd image-denoising
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Mount your Google Drive:
    ```python
    from google.colab import drive
    drive.mount('/content/drive')
    ```

2. Extract the dataset:
    ```python
    import zipfile
    zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile('/content/drive/MyDrive/denoising dataset.zip', 'r')
    zip_ref.extractall('/content/dataset')
    zip_ref.close()
    ```

3. Train the model:
    ```python
    # Define the paths to your dataset
    train_noisy_folder = '/content/dataset/denoising dataset/image denoising/train/noisy'
    train_clean_folder = '/content/dataset/denoising dataset/image denoising/train/clean'
    test_noisy_folder = '/content/dataset/denoising dataset/image denoising/test/noisy'
    test_clean_folder = '/content/dataset/denoising dataset/image denoising/test/clean'

    # Create image data generators
    batch_size = 32
    train_generator = image_generator(train_noisy_folder, batch_size=batch_size)
    test_generator = image_generator(test_noisy_folder, batch_size=batch_size)

    # Define and compile the model
    unet = unet_model((None, None, 1))
    unet.compile(optimizer='adam', loss=losses.MeanSquaredError(), metrics=[psnr])

    # Train the model
    history = unet.fit(train_generator,
                       steps_per_epoch=12,
                       epochs=50,
                       validation_data=test_generator,
                       validation_steps=6)
    ```

4. Evaluate the model:
    ```python
    test_loss, test_psnr = unet.evaluate(test_generator, steps=75)
    print(f"Test Loss: {test_loss:.4f}, Test PSNR: {test_psnr:.2f} dB")
    ```

## Results

The performance of the denoising model is evaluated using the PSNR metric. Here are the results after training:

| Metric     | Value    |
|------------|----------|
| Test Loss  | x.xxxx   |
| Test PSNR  | xx.xx dB |
